# Example project 2 #
This project illustrates plugin's ability to report SQLCover coverage for a sample database taken from [https://tsqlt.org/](https://tsqlt.org/) installation. Coverage report is already saved at **build** folder. When you run sonar-scanner that report will be parsed and reported to Sonarqube.
